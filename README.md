*FADSE* - Framework for Automatic Design Space Exploration. This framework is trying to include as much ADSE algorithms as possible, to offer connectors to existing computer simulators (M5, GEMS, Multi2sim, NS3, etc.) and to run in parallel the design space exploration process.

FADSE is currently able to:

    * perform automatic design space exploration using well known algorithms (tested with NSGA-II, SPEA2, SMPSO, OMOPSO; other available are: AbYSS, PESA2, FastPGA and many others from the [http://jmetal.sourceforge.net/index.html jMetal] library)
    * run the simulation in a distributed manner on multiple computers
    * fully integrated with the [http://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/en/chairs/sik/research/embedded/gap/ GAP] simulator and  [http://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/en/chairs/sik/research/embedded/gap/ GAPtimize] code optimization tool, [http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~msim/ M-SIM3], [http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~msim/ M-SIM2] and [http://code.google.com/p/unimap/ UniMap] simulators
    * partial integration (not all the parameters are supported) with: [http://www.m5sim.org/ M5], [http://www.multi2sim.org Multi2Sim]
    * included metrics: hypervolume (and hypervolume two set difference), 7 point average distance, coverage, hypervolume comparison between multiple runs, number of unique individuals generated by the algorithm, etc (see [ComputeMetricsWithFADSE Compute Metrics with FADSE]).
    * included monitoring application that enables the user to observe the progress of the algorithm
    * uses MySQL for database support (results reuse of already simulated configurations)
    * tested on: commodity networks (LAN), Windows based supercomputers, Linux based HPC 
    * reliable against faulty networks, faulty clients, faulty simulators
    * supported parameters: arithmetic/geometric progression, list of strings, boolean    
    * relations between parameters are also permitted (if p0==false THEN p1 and p2 are invalid)
    * fuzzy relations can be imposed between parameters (if p0 is small AND p2 is medium THEN p1 is large) - these rules might help the algorithm obtain a faster convergence 
    * constraints can be imposed (dl1_nsets*dl1_bsize*dl1_assoc>=4096B, dl2_size>dl1_size, etc.)
